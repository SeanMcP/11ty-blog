Born and raised in State College, Pennsylvania, I graduated from Edinboro University with a degree in Middle-level Education. After working for three years as a teacher in Pennsylvania and Georgia, I decided to switch careers.

I enrolled in The Iron Yard, a coding bootcamp in Atlanta, and—after a four-month whirlwind—graduated with a certificate in Front-end Engineering with React. I worked at TSYS Digital Innovations in Alpharetta, GA for a year and half before moving back to Pennsylvania to take a position with Niche.com in Pittsburgh.

When I'm not coding at work and at home, I enjoy spending time with my wife (married '14), son (born '18), and three-legged dog (adopted '17). We like to play board games and [would love to hear your recommendations](https://twitter.com/_seanmcp).

I also like soccer a little too much, but that's a topic for another page.
