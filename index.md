title: "I am Sean McP"

My name is Sean, and I'm a software developer and educator living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I'm interested in React, JavaScript, accessibility, user-experience, and good design.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, son, and dog), playing soccer and board games, and living out my faith.
