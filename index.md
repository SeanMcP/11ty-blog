My name is Sean McPherson and I am a software developer in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm interested in React, JavaScript, accessibility, user-experience, and good design. I also organize [Jr Devs, a community for junior developers](https://meetup.com/jrdevsatl).

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, son, and dog), playing soccer and board games, and living out my faith.
