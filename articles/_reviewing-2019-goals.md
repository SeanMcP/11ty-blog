To kick-off 2019, I wrote an article in which I [set some goals for 2019](./2018-into-2019). I had planned to check in on those goals more frequently:

> I am going to check back on these goals throughout the year and track my progress in a different article.

But alas, the best laid plans of mice and men!

Now that it is December of 2019, I wanted to take the chance to measure my progress towards those twelve goals that I set.

## Review

### üëé Dive deeper into Python

I didn't do anything more with Python this year. I even turned away from Python for simple scripting projects in favor of Bash or node.js. I'm still a fan, but I don't see a big use case for Python in my current career path.

### üëé Learn machine learning

ML sounds cool and exciting, but there weren't a lot of opportunities to utilize it in my work as a front-end engineer.

### üëé Demystify module bundlers

This is still a good idea, but I haven't done it (yet).

### üéâ Release two npm packages

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Investigate React tooling

I learned a lot this year about tooling in a JavaScript environment, but I think my goal was a little misguiding in thinking that a `dotfiles` repo would be the answer.

### Publish 24 articles



- **Python**: I want to dive deeper in Python applications, including environments and dependencies, by **deploying a Python app**
- **Machine learning**: TSYS is interested in integrating ML into their applications, so I will **complete a course** in either Udacity or Udemy
- **Module bundlers**: I am lost (and confused) when it comes to module bundling, so I am going to de-mystify bundlers by publishing React **setup guides for Webpack, Parcel, and Rollup**
- **NPM Packages**: I want to learn about creating and maintaining open-source software by publishing **two new packages**
- **Tooling**: I want to investigate tooling options for React development that streamline the process and **create a personalized dot files repo**
- **Publish more articles**: It is my mission to help people, and one way to do that is to publish **24 articles (bi-monthly)**
- **Jr Devs Meetup**: I want to partner with a coding bootcamp to provide **instructors at every meeting**
- **Speaking**: I want to create a deck and **present at another Meetup**
- **Husband**: I want to take dating my wife seriously and **schedule a babysitter four times a year** for real dates
- **Father**: I want to use the time I have with my son more productively, **going on father-son outings twice a month**
- **Faith**: I want to **continue teaching Sunday school**, lead **family worship every evening**, and **read/reflect on the Bible daily**
- **Personal**: Dad bod is a real thing and is only around the corner, so I want to **exercise 6 days a week** (don't forget a [day of rest](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex+20%3A8-11&version=NKJV))
- **Soccer**: I want to find room in the family schedule to **play a pick-up game every week**
