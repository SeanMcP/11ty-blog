  - Used by folks at CERN, Google, Netlify, and CSS-Tricks
  - Praised for it's simplicity
  While some folks may have heard of Gatsby before, fewer will be familiar 11ty. Created by [Zach Leatherman](https://github.com/zachleat) in November 2017, 11ty bills itself as "a simpler static site generator." In a directory with only a single mark down `file`, 11ty can generate a static site with one command:
```bash
eleventy
```
- Gatsby
  - I like Gatsby
  - No major criticism
  - Would use for enterprise website
  - Great trajectory
  - Before I dive into my reasons for switching from Gatsby to 11ty, I would like to state: I like Gatsby. I have no major criticisms of the project and would turn to it first if I were making a rich static site for a small business or enterprise. All of the following are not reasons why Gatsby is bad but rather why I preferred 11ty for this blog.
- Simplicity
  - Meme
  - Diagnosing Gatsby problems
  - Gatsby problems on older systems
- Not React
  - React === reusability
  - Felt wrong creating 90+% single-use components
