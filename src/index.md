title: Software engineer and educator
---

Hey there! My name is Sean McPherson, and I'm a software engineer and educator living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I'm interested in all areas of front-end development: from HTML and CSS to JavaScript frameworks and developer tools.

Currently I work at Niche.com as a software engineer building web and mobile applications in React.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, son, and dog), playing soccer and board games, and living out my faith.
