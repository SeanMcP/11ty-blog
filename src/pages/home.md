My name is **Sean McPherson**, and I'm interested in all areas of front-end development: from HTML and CSS to JavaScript frameworks and developer tools.

Currently I work at Niche.com in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania building web and mobile applications in React. On the side, I like to work [on little projects](https://github.com/seanmcp) that help make people's lives easier like Toollama.com.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, two sons, and dog), playing and watching soccer, learning new board games, and living out my faith.
