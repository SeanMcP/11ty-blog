My name is Sean McPherson, or [Sean McP](../articles/how-to-pronounce-my-name) for short. I am a software engineer and educator living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

I am interested in all areas of front-end development and am always looking for opportunities to practice my skills and learn new things.

Since joining the tech industry, I have:

- Given a talk on "React && Accessibility" at CONNECT.TECH Conference
- Published open source libraries with tens of thousands of downloads on npm
- Lead workshops on React and the JavaScript ecosystem
- Given lightning talks at Jr Devs Meetup

## My journey

Born and raised in State College, Pennsylvania, I graduated from Edinboro University with a degree in Middle-level Education. After working for three years as a teacher in Pennsylvania and Georgia, I decided to switch careers.

I enrolled in The Iron Yard, a coding bootcamp in Atlanta and graduated with a certificate in front-end engineering with React. I worked at TSYS Digital Innovations in Alpharetta, GA for a year and half before moving back to Pennsylvania to take a position with Niche.com in Pittsburgh.

When I'm not coding at work and at home, I enjoy spending time with my wife (married '14), son (born '18), and three-legged dog (adopted '17). We like to play board games and [would love to hear your recommendations](https://twitter.com/snmcp). -->
