Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Sean McPherson, or [Sean McP](../articles/how-to-pronounce-my-name) for short, and I am a software engineer for Niche.com in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Before that, I worked for TSYS Digital Innovations in Atlanta creating products for financial institutions and their clients. I helped them focus on recruiting new talent and pushed for open-sourcing software.

I have had the opportunity to:

- Give two conference talks on accessibility and React
- Publish a few open-source libraries on npm
- Lead workshops on React and the JavaScript ecosystem
- Give lightning talks at a meetup

After college, I spent three years teaching at public and private institutions. It gave me valuable experience in learning, planning, and speaking, and my goal is to bring those lessons into all of my work. This website is an example of that

Outside of work, I spend most of my time with my wife (married '14), two sons (born '18 and '20), and our three-legged dog (adopted '17). I also [like soccer](../soccer).

## My journey

Born and raised in State College, Pennsylvania, I graduated from Edinboro University with a degree in Middle-level Education. After working for three years as a teacher in Pennsylvania and Georgia, I decided to switch careers.

I enrolled in The Iron Yard, a coding bootcamp in Atlanta and graduated with a certificate in front-end engineering with React. I worked at TSYS Digital Innovations in Alpharetta, GA for a year and half before moving back to Pennsylvania to take a position with Niche.com in Pittsburgh.

When I'm not coding at work and at home, I enjoy spending time with my wife (married '14), son (born '18), and three-legged dog (adopted '17). We like to play board games and [would love to hear your recommendations](https://twitter.com/snmcp). -->
