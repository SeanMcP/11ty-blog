The book is guide to conducting your own usability testing:
- simple, informal, small-sample, do-it-yourself usability testing (sometimes known as "discount usability testing")

Definition of usability testing:

> Watching people try to use what you're creating/designing/building (or something you've already created/designed/built), with the intention of (a) making it easier for people to use or (b) proving that it is easy to use.

**Qualitative** user testing: less formal, can change between rounds
- Test usually last one hour, but can be as short as 5 minutes and as longs as a day

Krug recommends one morning a month for usability testing:
- three individual tests
- a debrief over lunch

Build a short list of the highest priority items to fix.

Test early and often; resist the temptation to wait until you have a finished product before doing usability testing.
- "Start earlier than you think makes sense"

Test competitors sites, and focus takeaways on what went well

Avoid asking for an opinion or feedback; focus on what it is or what it does

Don't sweat about finding "real users" of the site: most of the usability issues can be identified by anyone using it.
- Outsiders can identify issues that those with domain knowledge might overlook (the emperor's new clothes effect)
- You can always filter out the issues they hit if you think a real user wouldn't experience it in the same way
- As times goes on and the lower-hanging issues are fixed, then look for representative users to polish the experience

Three user tests per round is Krug's magic number
- Frees up time to focus on rounds of testing
- Small enough to get done in a single morning
- Large enough to see common issues

When finding participants:
- Craigslist is a good option (maybe Facebook Marketplace?)
- There is a sample invitation on page 46
- Screen people ahead of time
