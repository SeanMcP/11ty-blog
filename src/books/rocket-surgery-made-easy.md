The book is guide to conducting your own usability testing:
- simple, informal, small-sample, do-it-yourself usability testing (sometimes known as "discount usability testing")

Definition of usability testing:

> Watching people try to use what you're creating/designing/building (or something you've already created/designed/built), with the intention of (a) making it easier for people to use or (b) proving that it is easy to use.

- Test usually last one hour, but can be as short as 5 minutes and as longs as a day
